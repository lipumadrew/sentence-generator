# Sentence Generator
I created this random sentence generator out of pure JavaScript. Words are stored in a dictionary object, in which they are organized by type. The sentence generator started out with basic subject-predicate sentences, and I continued to add features until the generator could randomly add various sentence structures. The sentences are somewhat halloween/fantasy themed. To use this, run the JavaScript file using the command line interface of your choice, and many random, wild sentences will be generated. Navigate to the folder and run the command `node script.js` and you're set!
