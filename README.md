# Sentence Generator
I created this random sentence generator out of pure JavaScript. Words are stored in a dictionary object, in which they are organized by type. The sentence generator started out with basic subject-predicate sentences, and I continued to add features until the generator could randomly add various sentence structures. The sentences are somewhat halloween/fantasy themed. In order to use, just click the button!
